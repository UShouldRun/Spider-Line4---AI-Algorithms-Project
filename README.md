# Spider Line4 - AI Algorithms Project - U. Porto - Faculdade de Ciências - IACD

This is a folder for a project to explore different types of AI algorithms, like minimax,
minimax with alpha-beta cuts and monte carlo search playing Spider Line4.
The file that should be ran is "main.py". The bots' code is written inside the "bots.py".

- STATE OF THE PROJECT: ON GOING -

All the code is free to use and experiment with, but this github account should be mencionned
as wll as the other developers mencioned (johnpierre, ...).

# DESCRIPTION OF SPIDER LINE 4 #

# AIM #

In this work, the aim is to implement a game for two players and solve different versions of this game,
using the Minimax search algorithm with αβ cuts and its variants.

Human-human, human-computer and computer-computer game modes are being developed, where the
computer is going to exhibit different skills (levels of difficulty) by the end of the project.
Computer performance'll also be compared regarding the different skills (hard, medium, easy),
corresponding to different evaluation functions, different depth levels of Minimax,
different successor generation ordering and variants of the Minimax algorithm.
Monte Carlo Tree Search with different configurations will also be used.

We are going to focus on the analysis of the results of the computer players (wins, draws, losses, and other quality
parameters, such as the number of plays to obtain the win/loss) and average time spent to obtain the plays.
