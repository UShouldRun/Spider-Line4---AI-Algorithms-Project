# SPIDERLINE4: AI Algorithms Project

This folder is a project to explore different types of AI algorithms, like Minimax,
Minimax with alpha-beta cuts and Monte Carlo search playing SpiderLine4.

The file that should be ran is "main.py".
The bots' code is written inside the "bots.py".

# STATE: ON GOING

# THE GAME

SpiderLine4 is based on the classic Connect4 game. But, instead of only being possible to
place the pieces from bottom to top, we can place them from bottom to top, top to bottom,
left to right and right to left. The first player to connect 4 pieces of their color wins.

# AIM

In this work, the aim is to implement a game for two players and solve different versions of this game,
using the Minimax search algorithm with αβ cuts and its variants.

Human-human, human-computer and computer-computer game modes are being developed, where the
computer is going to exhibit different skills (levels of difficulty) by the end of the project.
Computer performance'll also be compared regarding the different skills (hard, medium, easy),
corresponding to different evaluation functions, different depth levels of Minimax,
different successor generation ordering and variants of the Minimax algorithm.
Monte Carlo Tree Search with different configurations will also be used.

# Open Source Project Credits

We are going to focus on the analysis of the results of the computer players (wins, draws, losses, and other quality
parameters, such as the number of plays to obtain the win/loss) and average time spent to obtain the plays.
